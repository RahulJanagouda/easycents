# How to earn pocket money gracefully being a programmer?

Loose english translation of https://github.com/easychen/howto-make-more-money/edit/master/README.md

Although programmers have few girlfriends (mistakes), but the overhead is often not small. VPS, domain names, a bunch of paid software on the Mac, and Apple's devices that are updated every year are often rhythms of kidney insufficiency.

Fortunately, as a programmer, we have more money-making positions.

Some students cried: do not do a single thing. Yes, but not too good. It is indeed a simple and direct way to do private orders, but in my opinion, the input-output ratio of private ones is very poor and not optimal. But since it is mentioned, talk about it first.

## Private single
The ideal list or direct overseas projects, such as [freelance.com](http://freelance.com) and other sites. On the one hand because the knife is more cost-effective to earn the United States, before you see like WordPress write payment + send registration code that we can finish a weekend project, you can also go to 200 to 300 US knife; the other hand, Foreign orders more subtle.

The price of domestic [shixian.com](http://shixian.com) is also very good, but I strongly suggest that you do not leak real-name and real company information in the introduction, because it is too high profile. A classmate said that this is my weekend time, ah, how to use my love how to use, the company can tell me how? Although many companies do not prohibit working part-time in their employment contracts, such a high-profile dry-lining on the Internet simply provokes HR: "I am not working well" and "the company does not work overtime." Think of you as well as the product manager Say this demand can not be done, while they have time to do private single look. If your own boss would not promote such a person.

(I read these days to see again, the talent page is no longer show the name, and only use the avatar. So long as the work experience introduced a note, you can avoid the above problem.)

> This paragraph contributed by tvvocold classmates. China also has a software crowdsourcing platform CODING yards . Coding.net , a cloud-based software development platform based on cloud computing technology, serves as a communication and regulatory tool to rapidly connect developers with demand parties. The goal is to improve the efficiency of software delivery through cloud crowdsourcing. Yard as a third-party regulatory platform, will review all projects to ensure the clarity of project needs and provide payment guarantees, so that developers can complete the project development on time and get paid. You can here see the development of the evaluation of the city code.

Of course, Pig Journey I will not say more of this station, not suitable for professional programmers to demean one's worth.

## Side Project
Doing a Side Project will be more cost-effective than doing a private one.

The benefit of the Side Project is that you only have to invest in a specific area for a long time. This allows your knowledge to branch in a tree, creating a good knowledge structure instead of turning it into a bottle of outsourced oil.

There are two ways:

One is to be small and beautiful, to develop a functional application for a subdivision area, and then put on the market to sell;

The other is bigger and more basic applications (think WordPress), to facilitate others to add code directly above, customize the application they want.

The former is faster to do, but needs to do some sales on its own. The latter is usually open source / free + charging mode, which is easier to promote.

Some students will say, I wrote the Side Project can not sell ah. The selection of the direction of the project is indeed more technical, but the simple and brutal solution is to find a project that is selling very well now, but the product and technology are not that good, and make a bid for only half the price.

For example, Mac has a very famous writing software called Ulysses. I tried a very good, but it is expensive, 283RMB. Later saw Mweb, Lite is a free version of the coverage of the main function of Ulysses, the full version was only 98RMB, almost no thought to buy it.

Consultation
If you are less well-known in tech circles or especially proficient in one business, making money through counseling is a much easier way. Talk to a few hours in the coffee shop, hundreds of thousands of dollars on the hand.

Domestic products in this area, I know the following few:

In the line : This is the shell of the shell, done earlier, the content is the industry, so the technology above but not much.
Founder of the school : Founder of the light partnership section, mainly for entrepreneurs, suitable for enjoying the entrepreneurial atmosphere of technical experts.
Very cow : You may think this is a programmer version of the "line", I browsed the next, although the number is lower than the line about a lot, but relatively strong professional, expect them to come as soon as possible to promote open .
Chika : This project is my participation, for programmers, similar to "answer" paid voice quiz, just started closed beta, there are some Silicon Valley technology company students. Interested can see.
Although consulting is also a real name, it is totally different from private life. Consultation time is short, will not affect the normal rest, but will not affect the work; and most companies encourage technology exchange, so everyone's acceptance is high.

In addition to APP, I think fee groups can be done. For example, you can engage in a technology business group, find some business success of the students, do investment in classmates, law students, for business students to open, each received a few hundred pieces of annual fee. Then you encounter problems in the business process, some people can answer, do not think it alone. If you have a problem, people in the group can answer it; if it's not a problem, is not that better? A kind of selling insurance feeling, ha ha ha.

write an essay
Many students like to write a technical blog, in fact, the article voted for some sites there is royalties. Such as InfoQ, their home like to receive 3000 to 4000 words deep technical articles; royalties are thousands of words 150. Although not too much, but a long article of the royalties enough to buy an entry-level Cherry keyboard. The place where I like InfoQ is more lenient on their copyright requirements. After the articles have been posted on their site, you can post to your blog again; and the article can be used for publishing, as long as the original is marked on InfoQ.

See more details here: http://www.infoq.com/cn/article-guidelines

By the way, actually writing a book through a traditional distribution channel does not make as much money as writing an article. The royalties that I had before hand were 8%, and the figure would be even lower if I sold it through a network. E-book revenue will be better, I have written an article devoted to: " How to publish a small book via the Internet "

Markdown has been used to write the book, using Markdown is very good; but recently started writing technical tutorials class, found Markdown not enough, the main problems are ① does not support video tags, especially local video programs ② Code highlighting what is very troublesome ③ There is no footer note, the text description of the regional preset.

Here to seriously recommend Asciidoc , you can think of it as an enhanced version of Markdown, preset a lot of common formats, and GitBook directly to support this format (as long as the. Md done. Adoc like), Atom There are also live preview plugins. Spent a period of time, I really like it.

Back in Time I will update my experience of using Asciidoc to write a book to "How to Publish a Small Book via the Internet" and follow my WeChat public number .

@ Rambone microblogging students added that the article can also be sent to microblogging, WeChat, Jane books and other support play reward platform.

Teaching video
Microblogging @ Guagua shot friends gave their application process teaching site lecturer's experience: application procedures teaching website lecturer, a video + homework tutorial, the platform paid by the hour, do not know if I do not know pocket money, I forget Last year, about 20 hours a year video, get the hand is less than 60,000 look, usually the weekend to spend time to get down.

After you teach online, recording instructional videos can also make money. The benefits of recording online courses have never been known to the majority of programmers. But recently 51CTO College and Netease cloud classroom students chat, only to find a good section of 40 to 60 micro-professional courses, one-year comparable income gains, senior director of the first-tier cities. No wonder so many people are training lately😂

In the form of curriculum, I personally prefer the graphic / video mode of designcode.io . On the one hand, learners can quickly scroll through the knowledge they have learned quickly; on the other hand, Headline articles, WeChat public number, Know and Jane column these long text promotion channels.

Of course, the content itself is the core. Now so many free videos, why buy your paid version?

In fact, the vast majority of instructional videos are often really just teaching, and the problems we encounter in the real world are quite different. Inside are a bunch of simplified post-mortem projects, designed for teaching purposes.

Here to share with you one thought I wanted to operate before.

It is in their own decision to start doing an open source project, with the screen recording software to record the entire process completely intact. Open source screen recording tools OBS , 1920 * 1080 screen recorded FLV format, an hour only need 1G, a T mobile hard disk can record thousands of hours, for a medium-sized project is enough.

And other projects done, open source to GitHub, let us use it first. After the iteration is stable, a series of tutorials are edited from the recorded full video, a series of articles are sorted out, and the fee-based courses are put on the website.

There are several benefits to doing this:

To ensure that all the problems encountered are real, not imagined, those who have studied this course, the entire project can be achieved independently.
There is no deliberate recording process, so the tutorial is actually a by-product of software development, with a higher input-output ratio.
If your software is well-written, then anyone who has used your software can become your client or referral.
Internal recommendation and executive search recommended
If you work for a first-rate Internet company such as BAT and you have a group of like-minded programmer friends, you should meet colleagues and friends who want to change jobs every few months, so do not miss out on your earned Great opportunity to recommend fees.

In general, less money recommended within the company, I have seen the majority of 3000 ~ 6000. But because it is their own company, will be more reliable, so the risk is smaller. Often recommend to the company talent, but also enhance the boss most of your favor, priority can be given priority.

Compared with the internal recommendation, recommended recommended headhunting will be much more. A 30 million annual salary of programmers, after the successful introduction of almost 10,000 yuan can get the recommended fee. However, the problem with headhunter channels is that the quality of resumes is very high. It is easy to have a background of well-known companies. The payback period is particularly long. Generally speaking, it takes half a year to get a full recommendation fee after entering the probationary period.

If you do not have a good channel for your recommendation, here's a channel for a recommendation fee of 5,000 to 4% of annual salary: JobDeer Talent Referral Platform . Different from other recommended channels is the candidate's resume on the line, was viewed, about the interview will receive wechat push. Tips: Because of the client's request, JobDeer is now a lot more demanding candidates, low probability of non-famous company background. Alas, this tagged society ┑ (¯Д ¯) ┍

summary
Learning to earn money is a very important thing that will let you know how business is working, helping you understand the company's product logic and laying a solid foundation for your possible technology startup.

So I encourage everyone to earn more money, best to try all kinds of postures, there will be unexpected fun. If you have better skills to earn pocket money, welcome to send PR over, I will pick a good merger :)
